Running the application ******************************************

The application can be run in Unity. Simply load it as a project. 

Meshes are loaded from Assets/Resources/Kidney_bone_meshes. New meshes can be added here. The whole of the folder is loaded so only include the meshes of a particular model. 

Meshes have to be in Unity compatible format, preferable 3ds or Obj. 
	* VTK can be converted to STL in 3DSlicer 
	* STL can then be converted to obj/3ds using online converters : http://www.greentoken.de/onlineconv/ 

The Model_Controller script looks for the name of the structure and so each mesh must follow the naming convention below so appropriate colours are added. With file name
containing : 
	“art” – Artery 
	“ven” – Vein 
	“uri” – Urethra
	“kid” – Kidney 
	“med” – Medulla 
	“bon” – Bone 
	“tum” – Tumour 

New structures not listed above must have colours added to the colour store Game Object and then update the Model_Controller script so the naming convention loads the colour 
to the structure.
